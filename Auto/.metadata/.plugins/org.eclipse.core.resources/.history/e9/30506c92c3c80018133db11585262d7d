/*The problem with threads not seeing the latest value of a variable because it has not yet been written back to 
 * main memory by another thread, is called a "visibility" problem.The updates of one thread are not visible to other 
 * threads.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The Java volatile Visibility Guarantee::
   The Java volatile keyword is intended to address variable visibility problems. By declaring the counter variable 
   volatile all writes to the counter variable will be written back to main memory immediately. Also, all reads of the
   counter variable will be read directly from main memory.

   Here is how the volatile declaration of the counter variable looks:

public class SharedObject {

    public volatile int counter = 0;

}
 * As I have mentioned earlier, if two threads are both reading and writing to a shared variable, then using the volatile 
 * keyword for that is not enough. You need to use a synchronized in that case to guarantee that the reading and 
 * writing of the variable is atomic. Reading or writing a volatile variable does not block threads reading or writing.
 *  For this to happen you must use the synchronized keyword around critical sections.
 * 
 * 
 *  the volatile keyword in Java is used as an indicator to Java compiler and Thread that do not cache value of 
 *  this variable and always read it from main memory.
