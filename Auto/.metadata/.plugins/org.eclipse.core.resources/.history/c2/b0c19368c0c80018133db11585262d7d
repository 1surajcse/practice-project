/*The problem with threads not seeing the latest value of a variable because it has not yet been written back to 
 * main memory by another thread, is called a "visibility" problem.The updates of one thread are not visible to other 
 * threads.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The Java volatile Visibility Guarantee
   The Java volatile keyword is intended to address variable visibility problems. By declaring the counter variable 
   volatile all writes to the counter variable will be written back to main memory immediately. Also, all reads of the
   counter variable will be read directly from main memory.

   Here is how the volatile declaration of the counter variable looks:

public class SharedObject {

    public volatile int counter = 0;

}
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * */
public class VolatileKeyword {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		

	}

}
